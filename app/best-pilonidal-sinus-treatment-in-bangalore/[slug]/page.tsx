      faqTitle: "What causes pilonidal sinus?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Pilonidal sinus is primarily caused by loose hairs that penetrate the skin in the natal cleft (buttock crease) and trigger an inflammatory reaction. Risk factors include excessive body hair, prolonged sitting (desk jobs, long drives), obesity, deep natal cleft, poor hygiene, and family history. Friction and sweating worsen the condition.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Can pilonidal sinus heal on its own without treatment?",
      faqAnswer:
        "No. Pilonidal sinus does not resolve spontaneously. While symptoms may temporarily improve after an abscess drains naturally, the underlying sinus tract remains and will inevitably cause recurrent infections. Early professional treatment is essential for permanent cure and to prevent the condition from becoming more complex.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Is laser treatment effective for pilonidal sinus?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Yes. Laser treatment is highly effective for pilonidal sinus, offering a minimally invasive option with reduced pain, bleeding, and recovery time compared to traditional surgery.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "How long does recovery take after laser pilonidal sinus treatment?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Most patients return to normal activities within 3–5 days after laser treatment. You can sit comfortably within 2–3 days, and return to work within a week. In contrast, traditional open surgery may require 4–8 weeks of recovery with daily wound care.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Will my pilonidal sinus come back after treatment?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Recurrence rates depend on the treatment method and post-operative care. Laser treatment has a 5–10% recurrence rate, while flap procedures have the lowest rates (under 3%). Following aftercare instructions — including regular hair removal, good hygiene, and weight management — significantly reduces recurrence risk.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "How much does pilonidal sinus treatment cost at Chirag Hospitals?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Treatment costs vary based on the complexity and technique used. Laser treatment is competitively priced, and zero-interest EMI through GMoney, and transparent pricing with no hidden charges. Contact 08065916415 for a personalized cost estimate.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Who is at highest risk for pilonidal sinus?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Young males between 15–35 years are most commonly affected. Risk is higher for those with sedentary occupations (IT professionals, drivers, students), excessive body hair, obesity, deep natal cleft, and family history. The condition is rare before puberty and after age 45.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Is pilonidal sinus surgery painful?",
      faqAnswer:
        "With modern laser treatment, pain is minimal. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia or short general anesthesia, and most patients report only mild discomfort for 1–2 days after, manageable with standard pain medication. Traditional open surgery involves more significant post-operative pain.",
