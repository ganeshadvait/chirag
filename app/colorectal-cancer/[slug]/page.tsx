However, in recent years, cases have also been increasing in younger age groups. In many Western countries, colon cancer is more common than rectal cancer. In India, rectal cancer has historically been reported more often, with men affected more frequently than women.",
      "Colorectal cancer usually begins in the innermost lining of the colon or rectum, called the mucosa. Over time, it can grow deeper into the wall through the submucosa, muscularis propria, and outermost layer known as the serosa (or surrounding tissues, depending on the location). The depth of spread, along with lymph node involvement and spread to other organs, helps determine the stage of the disease.",
