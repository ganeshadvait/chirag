      faqTitle: "What is the difference between hemorrhoids (piles) and rectal prolapse?",
      faqAnswer:
        "While both can cause a protrusion from the anus, they are different conditions. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in the anal canal, while rectal prolapse involves the actual rectal wall turning inside out. Rectal prolapse produces concentric circular folds of tissue, whereas prolapsed hemorrhoids appear as separate grape-like swellings. A specialist can distinguish between them through clinical examination.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Can rectal prolapse be cured without surgery?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Early internal prolapse (Stage 1) may improve with conservative measures including dietary changes, pelvic floor exercises, and biofeedback. However, external rectal prolapse (Stages 2-3) requires surgical correction for lasting relief. Conservative measures alone cannot fix a full-thickness prolapse, though they play an important role in post-surgical recovery.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "What is laparoscopic rectopexy and why is it preferred?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Laparoscopic rectopexy is a keyhole surgery where the rectum is mobilized and fixed (attached) to the sacrum through 3–4 small incisions (5–10mm each). It's preferred because it offers over 95% cure rate, preserves bowel and sexual function, causes less pain than open surgery, requires a shorter hospital stay (2–3 days), and allows faster return to normal activities (2–3 weeks).",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "How long does recovery take after rectal prolapse surgery?",
      faqAnswer:
        "After laparoscopic rectopexy, most patients go home within 2–3 days. Return to light activities takes 1–2 weeks, and full recovery including return to heavy lifting takes 4–6 weeks. Perineal procedures often have shorter initial recovery. Your surgeon will provide specific guidelines based on your procedure.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Will I regain bowel control after rectal prolapse surgery?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Many patients experience significant improvement in bowel control after prolapse repair. When the prolapse is corrected, the anal sphincter muscles are no longer stretched and can regain tone. However, if incontinence has been present for a long time, full recovery may take several months and may benefit from pelvic floor physiotherapy. This is why early treatment is important.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Can rectal prolapse come back after surgery?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Recurrence rates vary by procedure. Laparoscopic rectopexy has a recurrence rate of 2–5%, while perineal procedures have higher rates (10–20%). Following post-operative dietary advice, performing pelvic floor exercises, avoiding straining, and maintaining a healthy weight all help prevent recurrence.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "Is rectal prolapse common in women?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Yes, rectal prolapse is approximately 6 times more common in women than men, particularly after age 50. Multiple vaginal deliveries, hormonal changes after menopause, and associated pelvic organ prolapse (bladder, uterus) are contributing factors. Women may also have concurrent rectocele or cystocele that can be addressed simultaneously.",
    },
    {
      faqTitle: "How much does rectal prolapse treatment cost at Chirag Hospitals?",
      faqAnswer:
        "Treatment costs depend on the procedure type and complexity. Interest-free EMI options through GMoney, and transparent pricing. Contact our health advisors at 08065916415 for a detailed cost estimate based on your specific condition.",
